title: "The ART of self-discovery"
subtitle: "What is ART?"
description: "ART stands for Attention & Reflection Tracker and it is an experimental personal analytics technique that aims to bring awareness to the learning process. ART is for students who wish to keep track of their learning journey and visualize their growth. The data collected by the students with ART does not evaluate skills, learning objectives, or outcomes. ART's focus is on self-discovery rather than self-improvement. It is our conviction that noticing and tracking the process of learning is a transformative experience and as valuable as the learning itself. That's why we emphasize the acronym ART as being as important---if not more important---than the individual words from which it is composed."
