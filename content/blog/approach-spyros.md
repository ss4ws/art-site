### Mindfulness 

There is a plethora of contemplative practices specifically designed for the classroom. The following exercise is just an example of how I have integrated a brief meditation practice in the beginning of each class session.

In the beginning of each class session I invite my students to sit quiet for 2 minutes. I call this moment pause, meditation, or contemplative moment because I don't want to taint it in any particular way. Since it is recurring in each class session it becomes almost a ritual for the community that my students and I constitute in that particular class, that particular semester. 

Since we only sit still for a very short period of time (2 minutes), I prefer a silent meditation instead of a guided one. Before we start, however, I give my students some instructions. I invite them to find a comfortable position with their spine straight and their shoulders relaxed. Then I invite them to lower their gaze or to close their eyes if they feel comfortable in doing so. Then I launch my timer for 2 minutes. 

When we emerge from this brief contemplative moment, we greet each other with a smile and we start our work for the day. At the end of the session, when students fill out the ART form, one of the questions that are called to answer is "How helpful was your meditation today?" There is also space at the end of the form to take note of any other micro-reflection, or observation that they had during the 2-minute meditation. 

### Meta-cognition 

With every entry, students record a specific coordinate in their learning journey. At the end of the semester, their learning journey is represented as a data visualization chart. ART opts for the radar chart but presented in a minimal way without the scale, alluding to floral patterns and echoing the “students flourishing” metaphor. Grounded in their visualizations, students complete their final reflection for the course, hopefully being more open and honest about their progress, accounting for their setbacks, as well as their successes.

### Making

As its name suggests, ART also claims an aesthetic territory within the field of personal analytics. While all quantified-self enthusiasts expect statistical evidence to shed light on unsuspected patterns of their behavior, with ART, we also learn to value patterns themselves. In this case, students see the patterns issued from ART as abstract portraits of themselves. For that reason, we encourage students to take advantage of the variety of makerspaces and technologies available on UVA Grounds, new and old, to bring their portraits to life and keep them as mementos from the course. In previous semesters, my students and I have made patches using the Bernina embroidery machine at the Architecture’s School fablab, and we have teamed up with Rare Book School to print a limited edition poster with the letterpress technology of the enlightenment. Since these making techniques require equipment and specific know-how that may not be available to a broader audience we recently purchased a button press for an entry-level making experience. We are also planning to purchase a screen printing kit for students who want a more involved making experience.  
What would you make with your students using ART? Don't hesitate to drop us a line, if you have questions or if you want to share your experience with us.

# Questions to add to the form 

## Attention 

- Which activity capture more your attention today? / For which activity you were more focused today? 

- Which activity capture least your attention today? / For which activity you were less focused today? 

- Overall, in a scale from 1 to 10 how would you evaluate your focus? 


### Alternative questions about Attention 

Put theses extremes on a scale: 

- At least one or more activities captured your attention today and while working on them you experienced some degree of the following: you felt motivated, you knew how to go about it, and/or that the challenge was matching your skills. 

- At least one or more activities captured your attention today and while working on them you experienced some degree of the following: you felt demotivated, you didn't know how to go about it, you felt worried and/or anxious the challenge didn't match your skills.


With ART students are invited to approach their learning beyond judgment and grades. Students observe closely which activities capture their attention Rather, they see that learning is a non-linear process. 


## Skill vs challenge 

- How challenging where the activities today? Did they match your skill set? 

1. Challenge < skills. You felt apathy or boredom.
3. Challenge > skills. You felt worry or anxiety.  
2. Challenge = skills. You felt in control, or even you experienced flow. 

in fact, most positive experiences of flow occur when both challenges and skills are above their average point.
