### Test title
Among all of the aspects that shape and define the multiple ways an ePortfolio program can be set up reflection captures most clearly the student-centered nature of the pedagogy. Yet most students consistently resist the process, obviously not understanding what else they can get from their work once they've done it. Providing students with practice activities and reflection prompts helps, but it does not get at the deeper goal of acquiring agency that we would like for them to achieve.  Sometimes I have left the door open by telling students the purpose going over their work a second time is to discover "aha!" moments - to find insights and connections they may not have noticed in situ.  This gets at the question of agency, but is a hit-or-miss approach.  It happens for some students, but most come out empty handed. The fact is that most students simply do not have enough experience necessary to build a habit of reflection on a regular basis. Thus, two serious challenges surface when ePortfolio reflection is implemented in a course.  The first involves getting the students to voluntarily practice reflection on a regular basis as part of their learning experience.  Typical ePortfolio reflections are at a macro level (periodic reflection on specific assignments, or once on the course as a whole at the end of a semester, etc.).  These contexts are not only restrictive, but often also hampered by their association with unitized grading which is not conducive to genuine reflection on one's learning process.  Second, ePortfolios can suffer from the rigid separation of roles between teachers and students (something ePortfolio activities try to remove, but only approximately – unless, of course, students are creating eportfolios completely on their own initiative).  Consequently, it is difficult for students to grasp the significance of concepts such as “autonomy”, “agency”, and “self-authorship” which are the mainstay of ePortfolio pedagogy. 

Attention & Reflection Tracker (A.R.T.) is a quirky innovative use of form-based collection and visualization of personal data to help students develop a  habit of reflection over time. This activity extends the course environment connecting it with one that is outside of class and totally owned by the student. A.R.T. involves limited to no guidance or guidelines from the teacher.  At the end of each class session students fill out a simple self-evaluation questionnaire through which they collect data about themselves over the course of the semester. The generated information is not only used for its statistical value (which we consider minimal) but also (and maybe primarily) as a source for creative visualizations that can lead to metacognitive learning.  We argue that the use of personal data collected and visualized in this manner helps students to incrementally develop a reflective stance that can engage them in the broader construction of their [ePortfolios](https://firdyiwek.us).
