### Why ART?
Among all of the aspects that shape and define the many ways an ePortfolio program can be set up reflection captures most clearly the student-centered nature of the pedagogy. Yet most students consistently resist reflection, unable to understand what else they can get from their work once they've "completed" it. Providing students with practice activities and reflection prompts helps, but it does not get at the deeper goal of agency that we would like for them to achieve.  Sometimes I have left the door open by telling students the purpose of going over their work a second or third time is to discover "aha!" moments - to find insights and connections they may not have noticed before.  This gets at the question of agency, but is a hit-or-miss approach.  It happens for some students, but many come out empty handed. The fact is that most students simply do not have the necessary experience to develop the habit of reflection on a regular basis. 

Thus, two serious challenges surface when ePortfolio reflection is implemented in a course.  Typical ePortfolio reflections are at a macro level (periodic reflections on specific assignments, or once on the course as a whole at the end of a semester, etc.).  These contexts are not only restrictive, but often hampered by their association with unitized grading which is not conducive to genuine reflection on one's learning process.   Second, ePortfolios can suffer from the rigid separation of roles between teachers and students (something ePortfolio activities try to remove, but only approximately – unless, of course, students are creating eportfolios completely on their own initiative).  Consequently, it is difficult for students to grasp the significance of concepts such as “autonomy”, “agency”, and “self-authorship” which are the mainstay of ePortfolio pedagogy.   

Attention & Reflection Tracker is, as a colleague once described it "a quirky innovation" using form-based collection and visualization of personal data to help students voluntarily develop the  habit of reflection over time. Becasue the structure of ART as an assignment ranges from limited to no guidance or guidelines at all from the instructor, it supports the ePortfolio goal of building student agency by overtly inviting the students's extra-curricular personal experience into the course environment. 
### ART Process
At the end of each class session students fill out a simple self-evaluation questionnaire through which they collect data about themselves over the course of the semester. The generated data could be used for its statistical value, but we consider that value minimal.  Instead, we emphasize the activity primarily as a source for creative visualizations that can lead to deeper metacognitive learning.  We argue that the use of personal data collected and visualized in this manner not ony helps students to incrementally develop a reflective stance, but it can also engage them in the broader goal of thinking creatively about the construction of their ePortfolio.
