### Initial thoughts

Use this form to _self-assess_ your path through the course. Questions will help you *notice* and *learn* more about the conditions of your learning environment, including moments of __focus and distraction__, **enthusiasm and apathy**, __energy and fatigue__.

You can complete the survey once each class meeting. Or twice, as a pre- and post-class survey. Questions encourage micro-attentions and micro-reflections. Micro-attentions can be things you notice about your body, surroundings, and interactions between them in this moment. Micro-reflections can be things you notice within a wider frame, including what's on your mind, happening later today, and elsewhere.

At the end of the semester, you can turn your personal data into a compelling visualization of your learning journey: a Radar graph, clothing patch, temporary tattoo, or a 3D print. The A.R.T Project is intended to be an easy, fun, and artistically creative project!
