### Data visualization and making 

### What have we made so far? 

- patches 
- limited edition letter press poster 

### Going forward 

In the fall 2021 semester we would like to work at the Learning Design & Technology Department's makerspace run by Jason Bennett and make buttons and silk screen prints from the visualizations.
