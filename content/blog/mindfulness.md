### Mindfulness practice in the classroom

In the beginning of each class session I invite my students to sit quiet for 2 minutes. I call this moment pause, meditation, quiet moment because I don't want to taint it in any particular way. Since it is recurring in each class session it becomes almost a ritual for the community that my students and I constitute in that particular class, that particular semester. 

Since we only sit still for a very short period of time (2 minutes), I prefer a silent meditation instead of a guided one. Before we start, however, I give my students some instructions. I invite them to find a comfortable position with their spine straight and their shoulders relaxed. Then I invite them to lower their gaze or to close their eyes if they feel comfortable in doing so. Then I launch my timer for 2 minutes. 

When we emerge from this brief contemplative moment, we greet each other with a smile and we start our work for the day. At the end of the session, when students fill out the ART form, one of the questions that are called to answer is "How helpful was your meditation today?" There is also space at the end of the form to take note of any other micro-reflection (see also the post about [meta-cognition]()), or observation that they had during the 2-minute meditation.
