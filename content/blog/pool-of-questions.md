The ART questionnaire is customizable and can be adapted to any teaching situation. Browse the questions that are available below, and add yours in the pool. What would you like your students to track about their learning process? Keep in mind that each answer represents a point in a graph and, for that reason, it works better if it is a number. Preferably, frame your questions on a scale (i.e. 1 - 5) and keep open-ended question to a minimum. The initial ART questionnaire had only one open-ended question. We started calling it micro-reflection and that name stuck. Micro-reflections are meant to ease the way to bigger reflection prompts that students are invited to produce in their e-portfolios.  

We wish that this pool of questions will grow organically over time and that it would be a helpful starting point of inspiration for instructors who wish to start experimenting with ART in the classes.
