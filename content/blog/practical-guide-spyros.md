### Introduction  

The intention behind this guide is to help students create their individual visualizations from their data. Since their data lives in a spreadsheet in their professor Google Drive, as a prerequisite step the professor needs to provide an individualized version of the spreadsheet to each student. The initial cleaning of the spreadsheet by the professor may be a somewhat fastidious task (see task) but it doesn't involve any particular expertise in data analytics. It only requires patience and careful attention.   

### How to create your radar chart from your data at the end of the semester.

1. In the spreadsheet provided by your professor, select your data. Ignore the first row with the titles. 
2. Insert > Chart
3. Chart Editor > Chart Type > Radar Chart
4. Chart Editor > Customize > Radar > Uncheck "Show range gridlines" 
5. Chart Editor > Customize > Series > Data series > Manually change the color of data series from 1 - 5 to black and choose line thickness 4 px.
6. Click on the 3 vertical dots > Download > Choose the file format of your file format .png, .pdf, or .svg. Makers, you can always come back to this step if you need a to pick a different file format for your projects.  

This visualization is an abstract portrait of your learning journey. What do you think about it? How would you describe your learning journey based on this visualization?
