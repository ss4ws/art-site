### How to create your radar chart from your data at the end of the semester. 

This guide is intended to help students create their individual visualizations from the data they have been collecting throughout the semester. You don't need to have any expertise in data analytics but you need to be patient and follow the steps carefully.  

1. In the spreadsheet provided by your professor, select your data. Ignore the first row with the titles. 
2. Insert > Chart
3. Chart Editor > Chart Type > Radar Chart
4. Chart Editor > Customize > Radar > Uncheck "Show range gridlines" 
5. Chart Editor > Customize > Series > Data series > Manually change the color of data series from 1 - 5 to black and choose line thickness 4 px.
6. Click on the 3 vertical dots > Download > Choose the file format of your file format .png, .pdf, or .svg. Makers, you can always come back to this step if you need a to pick a different file format for your projects.  

This visualization is an abstract portrait of your learning journey. What do you think about it? How would you describe your learning journey based on this graph?
