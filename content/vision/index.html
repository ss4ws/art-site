      Spyridon Simotas is an Assistant Professor who teaches French language and culture at the University of Virginia. He believes in the transformative experiences of education as a path to self-discovery. Inspired by a series of artists who use personal data as creative material, he developed ART as an e-portfolio companion in an effort to encourage mindfulness, meta-cognition, and making in his classes.<br>

        Justin Greenlee is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the art history department at Kenyon College and a lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. His research and teaching interests pertain to late medieval and early modern art in Italy, particularly objects that are created, acted on, and restored many times—works that frustrate a study of the moment of creation and involve analyses that move across time and geographic borders.
        <br>
        <br>
        Justin joined the ART project in summer 2021, when he developed a set of question to help students notice more about the conditions of their learning environment. Prompts encourage <i>micro-attentions</i> and <i>micro-reflections</i> that engage  with elements of focus and distraction, enthusiasm and apathy, energy and fatigue. Micro-attentions can be things a student notices about their body, their surroundings, and the interactions between them. Micro-reflections can be thing they notice in a slightly expanded frame, including what's on their mind, happening later today, and elsewhere.
        <br>
        <br>
        He hopes to work with students in Fall 2021 to turn the data they collect throughout the semester into a compelling visualization of their learning journey: specifically, a Radar graph on a sticker, clothing patch, pin, or temporary tattoo. In his iteration, ART will be an easy, fun, and artistically creative project! For more information about Justin's research and teaching, visit <a href="justingreenlee.net">justingreenlee.net</a>.
